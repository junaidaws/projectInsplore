                            GST was proposed in India with effect from 1 April 2017 - with the motto One Country, One Tax, One Market. It is one of the most significant indirect tax reforms announced by the Government. GST is a massive reform of indirect taxes levied by the Central and the State Government of India.

                            We believe that the struggle in operating in multiple jurisdictions gives opportunities to reduce costs and gain market share. In contrast, the jumbles of the laws make overseas outreach a complicated and cost-bearing factor for the company. We are a team with technical expertise to help you navigate through your profit & Loss charts under the tax laws worldwide as well as national legislation such as the Goods and Services Tax, India.
